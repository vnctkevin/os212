## Week 01 (5/09/21 - 12/09/21)

1. [Containers vs VMs](https://www.insia.net/en/containers-vs-vms/) <br>
The difference between containers vs. VMs is primarily in the location of the virtualization layer and the way that operating system resources are used. VMs rely on a hypervisor which is normally installed atop the actual “bare metal” system hardware. With containers, a host operating system is installed on the system first, and then a container layer (such as LXC or libcontainer) is installed atop the host OS which is usually a Linux variant.
2.  [Full virtualization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/full-virtualization)<br>
Full virtualization is a virtualization technique used to provide a VME that completely simulates the underlying hardware. In this type of environment, any software capable of execution on the physical hardware can be run in the VM, and any OS supported by the underlying hardware can be run in each individual VM. 
3.  [Other things about virtualization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/virtual-machine-monitor)<br>
A virtual machine (VM) is an isolated environment that appears to be a whole computer but actually only has access to a portion of the computer resources. In virtualization, hypervisor, or VMM, is the software layer that sits underneath the guest operating system allowing it to believe there is really hardware in place

4.  [Vi commands](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/helpdocs/vi.html)<br>
Vi thankyou.txt

5. [Nano Commands Cheat Sheet](https://www.nano-editor.org/dist/latest/cheatsheet.html)<br>
GNU nano is an easy to use command line text editor for Unix and Linux operating systems. I use nano as Vi's alternative.

6. [Bash in 100 seconds (YouTube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4EWvMFj37g)<br>
Bash (The Bourne Again SHell) is a Unix shell that operates around a kernel (as what a "shell" is) and allows humans to interact with the computer whenever they want to. Shell let us people to interact, program, and do things in the computer in the presumably most basic way, command line interface.

7. [Another Bash Crash Course](https://opensource.com/resources/what-bash)<br>
Bash is a legitimate interface to your computer, and it's not just for server admins and programmers. It can be your desktop, your word processor, your graphics editing application, and much, much more. Some people use Bash more than they use desktop apps.

## Week 02 (12/09/21 - 19/09/21)

3. [SHA-256 Algorithm Overview](https://www.n-able.com/blog/sha-256-encryption) <br>
The SHA-256 algorithm is one flavor of SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm 2), which was created by the National Security Agency in 2001 as a successor to SHA-1. SHA-256 is a patented cryptographic hash function that outputs a value that is 256 bits long.

4. [Cryptography : Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o) <br>
From Caesar's Cipher to Enigma, Cryptography has a long history of being a way of securing sent messages and information. Cryptography is associated with the process of converting plain text into unintelligible cipher text and vice-versa.

5. [An overview of Cryptography by Gary C. Kessler](https://www.garykessler.net/library/crypto.html) <br>
This paper has two major purposes. The first is to define some of the terms and concepts behind basic cryptographic methods, and to offer a way to compare the myriad cryptographic schemes in use today. The second is to provide some real examples of cryptography in use today.
