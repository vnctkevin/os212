        <p>This website got nothing special in it. No CSS, no Jekyll, no nothing. Let me describe a little bit about this website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Muh lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your browsers</li>
            <li>Accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Legible and gets your point across (instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What will this website contains are:</h3>
