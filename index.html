        <h2>About me</h2>
        
        <p>Hello world. My name is Kevin (yep, only one word so you don't have any options on how to call me). I'm from Jakarta, Indonesia, and currently enrolled in Universitas Indonesia, majoring in Computer Science. I have interest in UI/UX Design and a little bit of Graphic Design. </p>
        
        <h2>What about the website?</h2>
        
        <p>This website got nothing special in it. No CSS, no Jekyll, no nothing. Let me describe a little bit about this website:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Muh lightweight and loads fast</li>
            <li>Fits on all your screens</li>
            <li>Looks the same in all your browsers</li>
            <li>Accessible to every asshole that visits your site</li>
            <li>Legible and gets your point across (instead of just 5mb pics of hipsters drinking coffee)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>What will this website contains are:</h3>
